          <p>
            Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming
            language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies
            as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended
            to let application developers write once, run anywhere
            (WORA),meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that
            support Java without the need for recompilation.Java applications
            are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual
            machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.
            The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level
            facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic
            capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that
            are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of
            2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use
            according to GitHub,particularly for client-server web applications,
            with a reported 9 million developers.

            portability and security, other factors also played an important
            role in molding the final form of the language. The key
            considerations were summed up by the Java team in the following list
            of buzzwords:

            <h2>Data types</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            Java defines eight primitive types of data: byte, short, int, long,
            char, float, double, and boolean. The primitive types are also
            commonly referred to as simple types, and both terms will be used in
            this book. These can be put in four groups:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Integers</b> This group includes byte, short, int, and long,
              which are for whole-valued signed numbers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Floating-point</b> numbers This group includes float and
              double, which represent numbers with fractional precision.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Characters</b> This group includes char, which represents
              symbols in a character set, like letters and numbers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Boolean</b> This group includes boolean, which is a special
              type for representing true/false values.

            <h2>Variables</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            The variable is the basic unit of storage in a Java program. A
            variable is defined by the combination of an identifier, a type, and
            an optional initializer. In addition, all variables have a scope,
            which defines their visibility, and a lifetime. These elements are
            examined next.
          </p>
          <span
            >In Java, all variables must be declared before they can be used.
            The basic form of a variable declaration is shown here:</span
          >
          <code>type identifier [ = value ][, identifier [= value ] ...];</code>
          <span
            >Here are several examples of variable declarations of various
            types. Note that some include an initialization.</span
          >
          <code>int a, b, c; // declares three ints, a, b, and c</code>
          <code
            >int d = 3, e, f = 5; // declares three more ints, initializing d
            and f</code
          ><code>byte z = 22; // initializes z.</code
          ><code>char x = 'x'; // the variable x has the value 'x' .</code
          ><code>double pi = 3.14159; // declares an approximation of pi</code>
          <p>
            The identifiers that you choose have nothing intrinsic in their
            names that indicates their type. Java allows any properly formed
            identifier to have any declared type.

            <h2>Control Statements</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            A programming language uses control statements to cause the flow of
            execution to advance and branch based on changes to the state of a
            program. Java’s program control statements can be put into the
            following categories: selection, iteration, and jump. Selection
            statements allow your program to choose different paths of execution
            based upon the outcome of an expression or the state of a variable.
            Iteration statements enable program execution to repeat one or more
            statements (that is, iteration statements form loops). Jump
            statements allow your program to execute in a nonlinear fashion. All
            of Java’s control statements are examined here.
          </p>
          <span
            >You will be pleasantly surprised by the power and flexibility
            contained in these two statements.</span
          >
          <p>
            The <b>if</b> statement is Java’s conditional branch statement. It
            can be used to route program execution through two different paths.
            Here is the general form of the if statement:
          </p>
          <code>if (condition) statement1; </code><code>else statement2;</code>
          <p>
            Here, each statement may be a single statement or a compound
            statement enclosed in curly braces (that is, a block). The condition
            is any expression that returns a boolean value. The else clause is
            optional.
          </p>
          <p>
            The if works like this: If the condition is true, then statement1 is
            executed. Otherwise, statement2 (if it exists) is executed. In no
            case will both statements be executed
          </p>
          <p>
            The <b>switch</b> statement is Java’s multiway branch statement. It
            provides an easy way to dispatch execution to different parts of
            your code based on the value of an expression. As such, it often
            provides a better alternative than a large series of if-else-if
            statements. Here is the general form of a switch statement:
          </p>
          <pre><code
            >switch (expression) {<br />  case value1:<br />    // statement sequence<br />    break; <br /> case value2: <br />   // statement sequence<br />    break;<br />.<br />.<br />  case valueN : <br />    // statement sequence <br />    break; <br /> default: <br />   // default statement sequence <br />}</code></pre>

            <h2>Introducing Classes</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            The class is at the core of Java. It is the logical construct upon
            which the entire Java language is built because it defines the shape
            and nature of an object. As such, the class forms the basis for
            object-oriented programming in Java. Any concept you wish to
            implement in a Java program must be encapsulated within a class.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because the class is so fundamental to Java, this and the next few
            chapters will be devoted to it. Here, you will be introduced to the
            basic elements of a class and learn how a class can be used to
            create objects. You will also learn about methods, constructors, and
            the this keyword.

            <h2>Inheritance</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            Inheritance is one of the cornerstones of object-oriented
            programming because it allows the creation of hierarchical
            classifications. Using inheritance, you can create a general class
            that defines traits common to a set of related items. This class can
            then be inherited by other, more specific classes, each adding those
            things that are unique to it. In the terminology of Java, a class
            that is inherited is called a superclass. The class that does the
            inheriting is called a subclass. Therefore, a subclass is a
            specialized version of a superclass. It inherits all of the members
            defined by the superclass and adds its own, unique elements.
          </p>
          <span>A simple example of inheritance.</span>
          <pre><code>// Create a superclass. <br>class A {<br>   int i, j;<br>    void showij() {<br>     System.out.println("i and j: " + i + " " + j);<br>   }<br> }  <br>// Create a subclass by extending class A. <br>class B extends A {<br>   int k;<br>    void showk() {<br>     System.out.println("k: " + k);<br>   }<br>} </code></pre>

            <h2>Packages</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            Packages are containers for classes. They are used to keep the class
            name space compartmentalized. For example, a package allows you to
            create a class named List, which you can store in your own package
            without concern that it will collide with some other class named
            List stored elsewhere. Packages are stored in a hierarchical manner
            and are explicitly imported into new class definitions.
          </p>
          <p>
            To create a package is quite easy: simply include a package command
            as the first statement in a Java source file. Any classes declared
            within that file will belong to the specified package. The package
            statement defines a name space in which classes are stored. If you
            omit the package statement, the class names are put into the default
            package, which has no name. (This is why you haven’t had to worry
            about packages before now.) While the default package is fine for
            short, sample programs, it is inadequate for real applications.

            <h2>Interfaces</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            Using interface, you can specify a set of methods that can be
            implemented by one or more classes. In its traditional form, the
            interface, itself, does not actually define any implementation.
            Although they are similar to abstract classes, interfaces have an
            additional capability: A class can implement more than one
            interface. By contrast, a class can only inherit a single superclass
            (abstract or otherwise).

          <header>
            <h2>Exception Handling</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            A Java exception is an object that describes an exceptional (that
            is, error) condition that has occurred in a piece of code. When an
            exceptional condition arises, an object representing that exception
            is created and thrown in the method that caused the error. That
            method may choose to handle the exception itself, or pass it on.
            Either way, at some point, the exception is caught and processed.
            Exceptions can be generated by the Java run-time system, or they can
            be manually generated by your code. Exceptions thrown by Java relate
            to fundamental errors that violate the rules of the Java language or
            the constraints of the Java execution environment. Manually
            generated exceptions are typically used to report some error
            condition to the caller of a method.
          </p>
          <p>
            Java exception handling is managed via five keywords:
            <b>try, catch, throw, throws,</b> and <b>finally</b>. Briefly, here
            is how they work. Program statements that you want to monitor for
            exceptions are contained within a try block. If an exception occurs
            within the try block, it is thrown. Your code can catch this
            exception (using catch) and handle it in some rational manner.
            System-generated exceptions are automatically thrown by the Java
            run-time system. To manually throw an exception, use the keyword
            throw. Any exception that is thrown out of a method must be
            specified as such by a throws clause. Any code that absolutely must
            be executed after a try block completes is put in a finally block.
          </p>
          <span>This is the general form of an exception-handling block:</span>
          <pre><code>try {<br>           // block of code to monitor for errors      <br>}       <br>catch (ExceptionType1 exOb) {<br>           // exception handler for ExceptionType1      <br>}       <br>catch (ExceptionType2 exOb) {<br>           // exception handler for ExceptionType2      <br>}      <br>// ...      <br>finally {<br>           // block of code to be executed after try block ends      <br>}</code></pre>

            <h2>Multithreaded Programming</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            Java provides built-in support for <b>multithreaded programming</b>.
            A multithreaded program contains two or more parts that can run
            concurrently. Each part of such a program is called a thread, and
            each thread defines a separate path of execution. Thus,
            multithreading is a specialized form of multitasking
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Process-based multitasking</b> is the feature that allows your
            computer to run two or more programs concurrently. For example,
            process-based multitasking enables you to run the Java compiler at
            the same time that you are using a text editor or visiting a web
            site. In process-based multitasking, a program is the smallest unit
            of code that can be dispatched by the scheduler.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a <b>Thread-based multitasking</b> environment, the thread is the
            smallest unit of dispatchable code. This means that a single program
            can perform two or more tasks simultaneously. For instance, a text
            editor can format text at the same time that it is printing, as long
            as these two actions are being performed by two separate threads.
            Thus, <b>Process-based multitasking</b> deals with the “big
            picture,” and thread-based multitasking handles the details.

          <p>
            Swing is a framework that provides more powerful and flexible GUI
            components than does the AWT. As a result, it is the GUI that has
            been widely used by Java programmers for more than a decade.

          <p>
            Swing did not exist in the early days of Java. Rather, it was a
            response to deficiencies present in Java’s original GUI subsystem:
            the Abstract Window Toolkit. The AWT defines a basic set of
            controls, windows, and dialog boxes that support a usable, but
            limited graphical interface. One reason for the limited nature of
            the AWT is that it translates its various visual components into
            their corresponding, platform-specific equivalents, or peers. This
            means that the look and feel of a component is defined by the
            platform, not by Java. Because the AWT components use native code
            resources, they are referred to as heavyweight.
